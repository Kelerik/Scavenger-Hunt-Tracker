# Scavenger-Hunt-Tracker

An experimental web app for the purpose of tracking players' progress in a virtual scavenger hunt game hosted externally.

Built jQuery and Bootstrap. Created as a side project to practice my skills early in my boot camp studies.

Currently suffers from a severe case of "programmer's UI".

## How to use

### Preparation

1. Add location names and descriptions using the fields in the sidebar.
2. Add player names using the field in the sidebar.
3. Right click on any player's name to edit or delete them.

### Starting/playing the game

3. Click the Start button to begin the timer.
4. Click on any player's name in the list to save their time and advance them to the next location. Repeat for each player until they reach the end.
5. If necessary, a pause/resume button for the timer is provided.
6. Right click on any player's name to undo their progress if necessary.

### Ending/Resetting the Game

1. Click the reset button in the bottom corner to reset the timer.
2. Click the yellow Progress button in the top corner to reset all players' progress.
3. Red buttons in the top corner are provided to delete all players, or everything (including locations).
